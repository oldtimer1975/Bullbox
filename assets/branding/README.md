# BullBox Branding Assets

This directory contains the branding assets for BullBox.

## SVG Files (Currently In Use)

- `bull-head.svg` - Brand mark/logo used on customer pages and headers
- `bull-courier.svg` - Courier bull illustration for home/landing and courier dashboard

These SVGs are minimal placeholders using brand colors and are actively used in the app to prevent bundling errors.

## High-Quality PNG Assets (Optional)

To use high-quality PNG versions of the brand assets, place the following files in this directory:

- `bull-head.png` - High-quality brand mark (recommended: 512x512px or higher)
- `bull-courier.png` - High-quality courier illustration (recommended: 800x800px or higher)

The UI can be updated later to swap from SVG to PNG if needed for better visual quality.

## Brand Colors

- Background: `#0F172A` (dark slate)
- Primary: `#E10600` (red)
- Accent: `#2563EB` (blue)
